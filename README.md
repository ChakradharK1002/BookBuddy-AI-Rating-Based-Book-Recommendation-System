# BookBuddy-AI-Rating-Based-Book-Recommendation-System
This project is all about building a personalized book recommendation system using user ratings. It reads book data from a file (Books.csv) and user preferences from another file (user_booklibsvmnew.libsvm). The system calculates how similar readers are based on their book preferences and then suggests new books based on those similarities.
